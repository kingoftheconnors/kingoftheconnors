### Greetings! ✨

I am a gameplay programmer with a bucket list of wacky projects! If you know something new, I'd love to work with you on it!

- 🔬 I'm a Maker, and I keep a lot of projects! My main body of work is my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYo_qp8XUVeuS2uPYRYA_A) where I hope to make videos documenting my different projects!
- 📔 I'm right now learning Godot! I'm making as many games as I can to increase my range. My most recent project is a [2d-styled version of A Hat in Time](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=71685.msg1436285#msg1436285), and a Networked-Multiplayer game inspired by Four Swords!
- 👯 I hope to find amazing people to work with. If you have a project or a passion for game-making, I'd love to hear from you!
- 📫 How to reach me: thegoodtrash.mcpherson [at] gmail [dot] com, or my Discord handle Kanor#0388
- 🖥️ I have a [portfolio of stuff](https://kingoftheconnors.github.io/) I make and do!
