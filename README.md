### Greetings! ✨

I am a gameplay programmer with a bucket list of wacky projects! If you know something new, I'd love to work with you on it!

- 🔬 I'm currently working on too many things right now, but my main project is my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYo_qp8XUVeuS2uPYRYA_A) where I hope to make videos on my different projects!
- 📔 I'm right now learning Godot, and making as many kinds of games as I can to increase my range. My most recent project is a [2d-styled version of A Hat in Time](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=71685.msg1436285#msg1436285)
-  💬 My projects range anywhere from games to web tools to machine learning networks! I like pushing the boundaries of what programming can do, and asking questions nobody should ask!
- 👯 I want to find amazing people to work with! If you have a project or a passion for game-making, I'd love to hear from you!
- 🖥️ I have a [portfolio of stuff](https://kingoftheconnors.github.io/) I make and do!
